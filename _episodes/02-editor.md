Editor integrates tools for an easy to use, efficient editing experience. 

The Editorâ€™s usual key features include:

* Syntax highlighting (`pygments`); 
* Real-time code and style analysis (`pyflakes` and `pycodestyle`);
* On-demand completion, calltips and go-to-definition features (`rope` and `jedi`);
* Function/Class browser, horizontal and vertical splitting.

## Expected Benefits

* Syntax coloring
* Integrated help [CTRL+I] 
* Panel layout
