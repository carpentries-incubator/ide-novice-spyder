The Interactive Terminal (in Spyder, the IPython Console) allows you to execute commands and interact with data inside any number of IPython interpreters.

Each console in Spyder is executed in a separate process, allowing you to run scripts independently.

A terminal/console/shell is an implementation of a read–eval–print loop (REPL), that is, input and executes commands, and returns the result to the user.

IPython Console features include:

* Introspection,
* Display rich media,
* Understand shell syntax,
* Perform tab (code) completion,
* and records History.

## Expected Benefits

* Immediate response to our ideas.
* Quick exploration of the available functionalities.
* Keep a record of our attempts.
* Work in isolated processes.

## Let's Write a first version of Bingo Cards printer

We will use the `print` function and the `for` structure to print the BINGO card in a nicer format.

### Things to pay attention to:

* Syntax coloring in the console
* Code completion in the console
* Integrated help in the console
* Each console is a separated process.

> ## String format
> https://pyformat.info/ is a nice resource to look for an overview and examples of python string formatting.
