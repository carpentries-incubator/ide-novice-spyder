The *Variable Explorer* shows the namespace contents (all global object references, such as variables, functions, modules, etc.) of the currently selected IPython Console session, and allows you to interact with them through a variety of GUI-based editors.

Spyderâ€™s Variable Explorer offers built in support for editing lists, strings, dictionaries, NumPy arrays, Pandas DataFrames, and more, and can also histogram, plot, or even display some of them as an RGB image.

Go to the *Variable explorer* and select the `bingo_card` dictionary or whatever you called it. Let's review its contents and the options available.
