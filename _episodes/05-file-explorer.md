The File Explorer panel is a built-in file and directory browser allowing you to view and filter files and their properties, open them with the Editor or an external tool, and perform common management tasks (varies by platform).

## Let's check the file explorer

Select the files in the current directory and check the available options by clicking the right mouse button.

Try to copy and paste the current file, rename the copy, create a new file.

## Let's convert our code to functions

Separate your code making two functions, the first one generates a random Bingo card.

After that, convert the remaining code in a second function that displays the Bingo card on the terminal.

Use these functions to write a program that displays a random Bingo card. Ensure that the main program only runs when the file containing your solution has not been imported into another program.
